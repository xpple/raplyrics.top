        <h2>Verse 1: Eminem</h2>
        <p class="verse">
            Here we go aga-ain, from heroes to villains
            Used to be your Romeo, but we both were jilted
            A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
            But still, it gave me hope that we'll get
            Through it together, a severed earlobe
            Mailed to you in a E-N-V-E-lope
            Would be dope, but what kind of lengths can you go?

                <span slot="text">Pull a Vincent van Gogh</span>
                <template>
                    Vincent van Gogh cut his ear off when situations intensified with Paul Gauguin, an artist with
                    whom he worked together in Arles.

            just to convince a damn ho (Damn ho)
            To be a housewife who outright lies
            She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
            I ran outside, why is she tryna act out?
            She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
            Guys, when someone you'd die for
            Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
            Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
            Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
            And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers (Illa, Illa, Illa)
            To plant the K-Y in, I'm gettin' accused by a whore
            Who smells like St. Ides and who's prob'ly screwed five more
            Guys, sucked eight-nine men
            I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
            Bitch, it's you I tore out the frame, I win
            Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
            And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
            In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
            When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
            I'm waitin' for the day I can
            Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been."
            "And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him."
            Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
            Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
            After you, I swore to make the grey skies end
            Here come the rays like when
            You get a pay hike and
            Am I the good guy or do I just play like him (Illa, Illa, Illa)
            And hope that he dumps you?
            It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!" (Fuck you!)
            Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
            'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
            Sinceâ€”
