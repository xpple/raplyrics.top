        <h2>Verse 1: Eminem</h2>
        <p class="verse">
            Here we go aga-ain, from heroes to villains <br />
            Used to be your Romeo, but we both were jilted <br />
            A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with <br />
            But still, it gave me hope that we'll get <br />
            Through it together, a severed earlobe <br />
            Mailed to you in a E-N-V-E-lope <br />
            Would be dope, but what kind of lengths can you go? <br />
            <annotated-text class="meaning">
                <span slot="text">Pull a Vincent van Gogh</span>
                <template>
                    Vincent van Gogh cut his ear off when situations intensified with Paul Gauguin, an artist with
                    whom he worked together in Arles.
                </template>
            </annotated-text>,
            just to convince a damn ho (Damn ho) <br />
            To be a housewife who outright lies <br />
            She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive <br />
            I ran outside, why is she tryna act out? <br />
            She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice <br />
            Guys, when someone you'd die for <br />
            Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more? <br />
            Another late night in, she stumbles through my door <br />
            Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more <br />
            And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers (Illa, Illa, Illa) <br />
            To plant the K-Y in, I'm gettin' accused by a whore <br />
            Who smells like St. Ides and who's prob'ly screwed five more <br />
            Guys, sucked eight-nine men <br />
            I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens <br />
            Bitch, it's you I tore out the frame, I win <br />
            Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in <br />
            And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends <br />
            In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels <br />
            When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get? <br />
            I'm waitin' for the day I can <br />
            Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been." <br />
            "And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him." <br />
            Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him <br />
            Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in <br />
            After you, I swore to make the grey skies end <br />
            Here come the rays like when <br />
            You get a pay hike and <br />
            Am I the good guy or do I just play like him (Illa, Illa, Illa) <br />
            And hope that he dumps you? <br />
            It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!" (Fuck you!) <br />
            Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then <br />
            'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in <br />
            Sinceâ€”
