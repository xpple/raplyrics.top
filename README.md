## No frameworks or libraries (\#no-bloat)
This website is written using only vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. That means absolutely no frameworks or 
libraries are used in the entire project. Everything is written from scratch! Even though I started this project merely 
as a challenge, I do believe that frameworks and libraries are often excessively used for relatively simple projects. In 
these cases a lot of bloat is unnecessarily introduced into the codebase.

As an example of this; routing. Most people suggested I should use a router library, instead of telling me how routing 
works. It turns out all you need is one line of code in an `.htaccess` file and some parsing logic. And even though my 
routing logic is most definitely inferior to a proper router in some way, for simple stuff this is all you really need.
